RandomSort
==========

This Java program demonstrates a custom random sort algorithm for a list of strings. The sorting is randomized using a custom hash function that incorporates a randomly generated seed. This ensures that the order of the elements is different each time the program runs.

Overview
--------

The `RandomSort` class sorts a list of strings in a random order by hashing the input strings and sorting them based on their hash values. The hash function is randomized using a seed generated by `SecureRandom`.

Features
--------

-   Utilizes `SecureRandom` to generate a strong random seed.
-   Custom comparator for sorting based on randomized hash values.
-   Ensures that the order of elements is different each time the program runs.

Implementation Details
----------------------

1.  **Random Seed Generation**:

    -   `SecureRandom` is used to generate a cryptographically strong random seed.
    -   The seed is generated using `random.nextInt()`.
2.  **Hash Function**:

    -   The hash function takes a string and a seed as inputs.
    -   It returns the result of XOR-ing the string's hash code with the seed, introducing randomness into the hash values.
3.  **Sorting**:

    -   The list of strings is sorted using `Comparator.comparingInt()` with the custom hash function.
    -   The custom comparator ensures that the elements are ordered based on their randomized hash values.
